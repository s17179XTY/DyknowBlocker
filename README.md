# Blocker

THIS IS A DIRECTORY-BASED BLACKLIST. This means that only the directories hardcoded in will be blocked. To run this, restart with airplane mode, log in, and wait until you're unblocked (DyKnow will take about 5 minutes to stop blocking you after a restart) then run the .jar file from a flash drive (just double-click). Then turn on wifi again and it will block DyKnow until either the next restart or until you right-click the icon in the taskbar and exit.
